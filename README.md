# pdf-say
A Python script to read aloud PDF files on MacOS using a selected voice

## Usage
This file is meant to be run from the **zsh** terminal on MacOS from within a Python environment. It triggers the **say** command, built in to the Mac shell system, to read the main content of PDF files with the option of choosing which of Apple’s library of virtual voices to use out of the available voices installed through

Assuming the user is familiar with setting up virtual Python environments, this script would best be installed in a virtual environment where the user keeps general purpose Python scripts for use as command line tools, so that only dependencies for any such simple CLI scripts would be installed in the virtual environment and other environments for more complicated projects would be unaffected. The developer’s system involves a general purpose environment named *allpy* managed through [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and its [virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) plug-in.

But **pdf-say** doesn’t really require any very complicated Python environment. Any default Python integration will probably suffice, and the only non-standard dependency needing to be installed is [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber).

### Command structure:

`./pdf-say.py /your/directory/content.pdf` with an optional parameter `-v "voice"`

For example, to narrate a PDF document named vansmarticus2022.pdf in a directory named *journals* within the folder containing *pdf-say.pdf* with the Apple voice named Moira:

`./pdf-say.py ./journals/vansmarticus2022.pdf -v "Moira"`

# Requirements

- **MacOS**: Sonoma 14.5
- **Python**: 3.12.3
- **pdfplumber**: 0.11.4
- **Terminal app**: 2.14 (453)

But it will probably work on several other versions of MacOS, including those whose Terminal app uses **bash** instead of **zsh**. It will probably run fine with many early versions of Python—probably any version after 3.6.

# Background

This script was generated by ChatGPT omni-1 on September 18, 2024 by a student needing to consider the content of six journal articles while doing his chores. The relevant class is related to a studio at SUNY Polytechnic Institute researching applications of AI and language models, focusing on data science, ethnographic usage, and applications for creative technology. We have been studying how to augment various workflows by using language models; consequently, this repo might be considered an applied experiment.

GPT o1 required one revision to make the first version of this script committed here, and the first version archived here in the first commit is fully working and represents the second generated script after telling the language model about an error produced when executing its first attempt. This was done in the standard web interface for ChatGPT/OpenAI. However, there are several previous prompt response exchanges in the conversation thread, which are part of the context in which GPT o1 generated the script as represented by the first commit.

# Possible future features

- Support for other document format
- Pausing, rewinding, and fastforwarding the narration using keypresses in the Terminal while the script is running
- Identification of the MacOS and Python versions for which the script works and support for more MacOS versions including the latest

# Features not intended for inclusion

- Support for voice tools other than the MacOS default **say** command

# AI Use Declaration

As of the current revision of this README, the entire content of the file **pdf-say.py** is AI generated, using GPT o1 through the standard OpenAI website. Every line of the script was human reviewed, and it was manually tested. This README is not AI generated. This last section of this README should always be updated to indicate the AI usage status for the current version of this project.
